## Mini-Course in Dynamic Programming

**Idea:** This course introduces you to dynamic programming using consumption-saving models as the primary example. 

**Requirements:** You are assumed to know basic Python programming. Else see [Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis](https://numeconcopenhagen.netlify.com/).

**Intended learning goal:** You are will be equipped to solve state-of-the-art consumption saving models, estimate them and embed them in general equilibrium models.

**This mini-course:**

1. Go through this notebook, `01. Introduction.ipynb`
2. Go through the notebook, `02. Your First Consumption-Saving Model`
3. Read the slides `ConsumptionSaving.pdf`
4. Go through `03. A Full Blow Consumption Model.ipynb`
5. Go through `04. Structural Estimation.ipynb`
7. Go through `05. General equilibrium.ipynb`

To learn more about how to solve consumption-saving models efficiently: 

1. Read the paper [A Guide to Solve Non-Convex Consumption-Saving Models](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10614-020-10045-x)
2. Go through the notebooks in `../01. BufferStockModel/` and `../02. DurableConsumptionModel/`
3. Look at the ekstra material in `../04. Tools/` and `../05. C++/`
